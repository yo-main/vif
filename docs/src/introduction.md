# Hello

Welcome to the documentation of the Zeus Language.

Zeus is being built with the aim of... taking over python !

Big claim, very low chance of success. Especially with someone like me. But hey, I'm building Zeus with that goal in mind and this is what keeps me motivated to work on it. 

Let the dream come true.

## The motivation behind Zeus

I love python. It's a wonderful language. It's beautiful, it's user friendly, it's elegant. It's the language through which I came into programming and I'm really grateful that it's python and not javascript (kidding (or not?)).

But damn, it's slow. It consumes much more energy than most other languages for doing the same task. And since it's one of the most used language all over the world, it's kind of drilling a hole in my soul. Zeus is my attemp of filling in that hole.

That's the initial thought. But building Zeus is also a way for me to play with rust and learn how to build a programing language, how it's compiled and interpreted.

So far it has been a very nurturing journey and I am far from having reached the end of it.

## The plan

Because I like python, I want Zeus to look like it. Buuuut I'll try to bring in some changes of my own, things to make it even more friendly and, especially, performant, I think. 

The problem of Python is that it's old. It cannott change much of its core functionalities because it's used by thousands. Zeus does not have that problem, literally nobody is using it.

But there's a small issue in my plan to conquer the world with Zeus. I have zero knowledge about building programming languages. I'm learning while building it. For sure this does not help in building Zeus in the best possible way, and there will be probable a lot of mistakes. So if you are here and reading that, please, don't hesitate to chime in and give me a hand ! 

Here are a bunch of things which are still to be implemented:

### Language features

- [x] variable
- [x] function
- [x] closure
- [ ] constant
- [ ] class/interface
- [ ] typing
- [ ] module
