# Hello

Welcome to the documentation of the Vif Language.

Vif is being built with the aim of... taking over python !

Big claim, very low chance of success. Especially with someone like me. But hey, I'm building Vif with that goal in mind and this is what keeps me motivated to work on it. 

Please do not come here to crush my hope, I don't need you to know that I'm playing myself. Just try to have fun with me while building something nice.

## The motivation behind Vif

I love python. It's a wonderful language. It's beautiful, it's user friendly, it's elegant. It's the language through which I came into programming and I'm really grateful that it's python and not javascript (kidding (or not?)).

But damn, it's slow. It consumes much more energy than most other languages. And since it's one of the most used languages all over the world, it's kind of drilling a hole in my soul. Vif is my attemp of filling in that hole.

That's the initial thought. But building Vif is also a way for me to play with rust and learn how to build a programing language, how it's compiled and interpreted.

So far it has been a very nurturing journey and I am far from having reached the end of it.

## The plan

Because I like python, I want Vif to look like it. Buuuut I'll try to bring in some changes of my own, things to make it even more friendly and, especially, performant, I think. 

The problem of Python is that it's old. It cannot change much its functionalities because it's used by thousands and you want to avoid breaking change. Right Python ? Right ? Anyway, Vif does not have that problem, literally nobody is using it.

But there's a small issue in my plan to conquer the world with Vif. I have zero knowledge about building programming languages. I'm learning while building it. For sure this does not help in building Vif in the best possible way, and there will be probable a lot of mistakes. 

Here are a bunch of things which are still to be implemented:
