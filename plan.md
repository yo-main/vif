Ok, let's go to work.

What our first goal ?
Being able to parse a small, easy piece of code I would say.

What piece of code ?

That one:

```
def entrypoint():
    world = "world"
    print("Hello", world)

entrypoint()
```

It's simlar to python right ?
That's a goal. I want people to be able to easily understand and migrate their python stuff to zeus without too much struggle.

Anyway, there's a lot going on already: we implement a function, define a string variable, send stuff to stdout through a `print` statement, use identation.
That would be a huge step to make that happens !

Things that can be added at that point:
- typing
- classes
- errors
- modules
- closure ?
- Null statement ?
